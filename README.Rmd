## What's `sl3`?

`sl3` is a modern implementation of the Super Learner algorithm of
@vdl2007super. The Super Learner algorithm performs ensemble learning in one of
two fashions:

1. The "discrete" Super Learner can be used to select the best prediction
   algorithm among a supplied library of learning algorithms ("learners" in the
   `sl3` nomenclature) -- that is, that algorithm which minimizes the
   cross-validated risk with respect to some appropriate loss function.
2. The "ensemble" Super Learner can be used to assign weights to specified
   learning algorithms (in a user-supplied library) in order to create a
   combination of these learners that minimizes the cross-validated risk with
   respect to an appropriate loss function. This notion of weighted combinations
   has also been called _stacked regression_ [@breiman1996stacked].

## Installation

<!--
For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("sl3")
```
-->

Install the most recent _stable release_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jeremyrcoyle/sl3")
```

## Issues

If you encounter any bugs or have any specific feature requests, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle/sl3/issues).

## Examples

`sl3` makes the process of applying screening algorithms, learning algorithms,
combining both types of algorithms into a stacked regression model, and
cross-validating this whole process essentially trivial. The best way to
understand this is to see the `sl3` package in action:

```{r sl3-simple-example}
set.seed(49753)
suppressMessages(library(data.table))
library(dplyr)
library(SuperLearner)
library(origami)
library(sl3)

# load example data set
data(cpp)
cpp <- cpp %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(haz)) %>%
  mutate_all(funs(replace(., is.na(.), 0)))

# use covariates of intest and the outcome to build a task object
covars <- c("apgar1", "apgar5", "parity", "gagebrth", "mage", "meducyrs",
            "sexn")
task <- sl3_Task$new(cpp, covariates = covars, outcome = "haz")

# set up screeners and learners via built-in functions and pipelines
slscreener <- Lrnr_pkg_SuperLearner_screener$new("screen.glmnet")
glm_learner <- Lrnr_glm$new()
screen_and_glm <- Pipeline$new(slscreener, glm_learner)
SL.glmnet_learner <- Lrnr_pkg_SuperLearner$new(SL_wrapper = "SL.glmnet")

# stack learners into a model (including screeners and pipelines)
learner_stack <- Stack$new(SL.glmnet_learner, glm_learner, screen_and_glm)
stack_fit <- learner_stack$train(task)
preds <- stack_fit$predict()
head(preds)
```

## Contributions

It is our hope that `sl3` will grow to be widely used for creating stacked
regression models and the cross-validation of pipelines that make up such
models, as well as the variety of other applications in which the Super Learner
algorithm plays a role. To that end, contributions are very welcome, though we
ask that interested contributors consult our [`contribution
guidelines`](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle/sl3/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
prior to submitting a pull request.
