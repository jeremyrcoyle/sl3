\title{Make a stack of sl3 learners}
\usage{
make_learner_stack(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Each argument is a list that will be passed to
\code{\link{make_learner}}}
}
\value{
An \code{sl3} \code{Stack} consisting of the learners passed in as
arguments the \code{list} argument to this function. This \code{Stack} has
all of the standard methods associated with such objects.
}
\description{
Produce a stack of learners by passing in a list with IDs for the learners.
The resultant stack of learners may then be used as normal.

\examples{
# constructing learners with default settings
sl_stack_easy <- make_learner_stack("Lrnr_mean", "Lrnr_glm_fast",
                                    "Lrnr_xgboost")

# constructing learners with arguments passed in
sl_stack <- make_learner_stack("Lrnr_mean",
                               list("Lrnr_condensier", nbins = 5,
